        <h2>Learning Empathic Design</h2>
        <p class="text">
            I am a junior at Brown University studying computer science and linguistics but I am also a dancer and a social media user and much more. The basic principles of empathic design trickle into all facets of our daily lives--here are a few ways I've explored that.

                        <h6>Abstracting away to the most basic building blocks:</h6>
                        <p>A deep dive into a simple interface, its exemplar users, and a typical interaction process. By interviewing users and reflecting on various situations in which this interface could be used, I developed an understanding for connecting even the smallest design choices to real people.</p>

                        </a>
                        <h6>From idea to prototype:</h6>
                        <p>After learning how to think about the actual users of each interface, I started to think about how to design for those users. Through this project, I challenged myself to design an application similar to Tinder for fish owners--this unique audience required me to think about elements such as color scheme, hierarchy, and usability.</p>

                        <h6>Keeping audience in mind:</h6>
                        <p>Building off of working with just a few users in the previous project, I redesigned a home page for an Indigenous languages of the Americas website. This time, I had to think about the usability needs for a much larger and varied audience, consisting of academics, Indigenous community members, families, educators, and more. How do I balance ease of usability with comprehensiveness of content to match the needs of all these potential users?</p>

                        <p>From redesigning a simple page, I worked in a group to mock up an interactive prototype for a real startup concept. Through this project we learned to incorporate feedback from peers and real user testing tasks to inform our design choices and break down our own assumptions about what is practically usable.</p>

            <h2>Studying a Bluetooth Speaker Interface</h2>
            <img src="images/cs1300assign1sketchtransparent.png" alt="annotated sketch of a Bluetooth speaker interface" style="width: 45rem; height:30rem">
            <p class="text">This is a speaker used by my dance team during practices and workshops. Its goal is to be a portable and convenient way to project sound from any device with Bluetooth capabilities. It has a carabiner on the side for carrying ease. It also has four buttons on the top for powering on/off, turning the volume up, connecting via Bluetooth, and turning the volume down. You press the power button once to either turn it on or off. To turn on Bluetooth pairing mode, you have to press and hold the button with the phone icon on it. To adjust the volume, you press either the volume up or down button.</p>
            <h3>Interviews and Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="text">To gain a better understanding of users' experiences using this speaker's interface, I interviewed three users with the following questions:
                
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>What emotions do you feel while using this speaker?</li>
                    <li>How easy or difficult was it for you to figure out how to use this speaker on your first try?</li>
                    <li>If someone new were to try to use this speaker, would you feel the need to explain any parts of the interface first? If yes, what?</li>
                    <li>If you could improve this interface in any way, would you? How?</li>
                </ul>
                The main takeaways from these interviews are summarized in the bullet points below.
                
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>There is initial confusion with connecting the speaker to a device: the Bluetooth button has a phone symbol, which confuses users</li>
                    <li>The order of the buttons could be improved by putting the volume up and down buttons next to each other rather than being separated by the Bluetooth button</li>
                    <li>The fact that there is only four buttons, one for each of the main functions of the speaker, makes it easy to use after you figure out how to connect it</li>
                    <li>It is not clear that you have to press and hold the phone button in order to start the pairing process; some tried to connect by pressing the power button instead</li>
                    <li>Most experienced users would explain the connection process to first time users, as it does take some time to figure it out on your own</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p class="text">Based on the interviews and takeaways, I created two personas to highlight different users' experiences with the interface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flextext">
            <p class="captiontextleft">COMPETENT CAM: Cam is a seasoned dancer and captain of the college team. Today she's going to be teaching a workshop for first-time dancers. Though she is familiar with the speaker’s interface, the unintuitive placement of the buttons makes it difficult to use while multitasking. Cam represents users who are used to the interface, but who can still face problems using it.</p>
            <p class="captiontextright">NEWBIE NICK: Nick just joined the dance team this semester, and is about to teach his first workshop. He has never taught before, and is unconfident in his abilities. He is using the speaker for the first time, while also handling other tasks. Nick represents users who have never used the interface before and the pitfalls such users may encounter.</p>

            <p class="text">Now that I had created personas, I imagined a scenario in which COMPETENT CAM would have to interact with the speaker's interface. I took into account her experiences and personality to imagine how the process of interacting with the speaker would play out.</p>

            <p class="text">This is a screenshot of the original webpage, which shows its lack of margins/padding, and its text-heavy hierarchy.</p>
            <h3>Usability Issues of the Original Webpage</h3>
            <p class="text">
                <ul class="text">
                    <li>Hierarchy is not clear: there are some links at the top of the page, followed by a long section of introductory text, and then followed by more links.</li>
                    <li>Several of the links on the page lead to the same page, but are worded differently and so make the user think they are different links.</li>
                    <li>On the flip side, there are different links that seem to lead to the same thing but don’t (ex, there is a section at the bottom of the page of recommended books, but the “Native American Books” link from the first section of the page leads to a different page entirely)</li>
                    <li>Visually, the page is very text heavy and requires a lot of reading in order to figure out where to navigate to</li>
                    <li>The search bars are confusing: there are two (one at the top, one at the bottom) and both have differently labeled buttons, but they both conduct the same Google searches</li>
                    <li>The search bar on the top of the page implies that the search will be within the site, but this is not the case–the search is powered by Google and therefore displays results from across the web</li>
                    <li>The lack of margins makes it difficult to read large blocks of text</li>
                    <li>If a user ever wanted to go back to the website a later time and navigate to a page they had visited previously, they could still have to read through the whole website in order to find the link since they are not organized memorably</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Accessibility Issues</h3>
            <p class="text">I passed the webpage through WebAIM WAVE to assess the accessibility issues of the page. The use of images without alt text as bullet points and section dividers makes the site less accessible (this error was flagged 98 times, from the sheer number of blue bullet point images on the page). The use of underlined section headers is also flagged as an issue. I agree that it is unnecessary to use an image of a bullet point several times on a page, instead of simply using a bulleted list in HTML or having fewer links on the screen. Additionally, underlined text usually signals a link, so the fact these headers are not links can confuse users’ mental model of the webpage.</p>
            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <h5 class="text">Based on the usability and accessibility issues identified above, I created low fidelity and high fidelity wireframes of the webpage on three possible device sizes.</h5>
            <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
            <p class="text">These wireframes were made in Balsamiq and roughly outline the new layout and hierarchy of the page. I decided to consolidate all the links into fewer clickable tiles, as well as group the tiles according to their theme.</p>

            <p class="text">For the most part, my redesigned webpage closely follows the high-fidelity wireframe in terms of design. The main change was using images for the tiles rather than solid colors to make the webpage more visually dynamic. Some screenshots are included below.</p>

            <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
            <h2>Designing an Interactive Prototype for a Startup</h2>
            <p>Internet Friends is a startup that is building Daylight, an app for making
                photo-only group chats. Our group designed an interactive application for
                this startup from scratch using only its concept. This involved working through
                a full iterative design process, from sketching ideas of the interface to
                creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype to conducting user testing
                on a final, revised prototype. We then contacted the startup to share our
                mockup with them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="pb-3">Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
            <h3 class="pb-2">Pre-design thinking</h3>
            <p>Before we dove into designing, we started by giving the concept a little more
                context and fleshed out some of the core functionalities and user groups. </p>
    
            <p class="pb-3">As a social app for creating photo-only group chats, Daylight allows users to stay in
                touch with friends through a constant flow of images, and if you’re in the same
                place as them, it makes sharing images even easier. Our group chose to create a
                mobile app interface for this product, as the mobile format facilitates easy
                photo-taking and sharing.
            </p>
    
            <div class="pb-3 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center">
                <h5 class="mb-3"><b>Target User Groups</b></h5>
                <p>Long Distance Friends</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This group consists of friends who might be far from eachother and want to keep in touch.</li>
                    <li>The app would help this user group keep each other updated with their daily lives using a photo
                        group chat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Friends Hanging Out</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This group consists of friends who might have a hang-out together and want to have one place to
                        share their pictures. </li>
    
                    <li>The app is used to provide a record of that time and an easy way to
                        access all the images taken together.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 class="pb-2 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center">Sketching</h3>
            <p>Each of our four group members then started brainstorming solutions by
                sketching out low-fidelity wireframes, aiming to reflect as wide a variety
                of screens and layouts as possible to get ideas flowing and to end with four
                different possible designs for the app. Each of these designs made sure to
                show the key functionalities of the app. These sketches were vital in
                visualizing our ideas, weighing the benefits of alternative designs, and
                avoiding premature decision-making. </p>

            <h3 class="pb-3 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center">Combining Ideas into Wireframe</h3>
            <p>After sketching, we regrouped and discussed whether our sketches
                were effective at solving the problem and diverse or creative.
                We then combined our ideas into a single wireframe that we created in Figma.

                <li>Chat is more like a “feed” than a typical chat format with messages back
                    and forth</li>
                <li>User can take multiple photos at once before sending</li>
                <li>Users can preview and select the photos they’ve taken before sending them</li>
                <li>Users are not able to upload photos from their camera roll to foster

                    a remote user testing service. Having test users try out our interface is a valuable
                    source of feedback. Below are the links to the user testing videos.

                <h5 class = "pt-5 pb-3">The Context</h5>
                <p>We started by giving them a brief scenario to provide context for what they’ll be
                    doing with the app:
                </p>
    
                <div class="pt-5 pb-5">
                    <p class="quote">“You're on a weekend trip in Boston with some friends.
                        You open this app to take pictures and share them with your group and
                        see photos that have been sent to you by others.”</p>
                </div>
    
                <p class= "pt-4">Then we determined tasks for them to complete on the prototype, focusing on
                    the primary functionalities of the app. The tasks were rated by Success (Yes or No) and a 
                    5 point rating scale (Very difficult to Very easy)
                </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Sign in to the app and quickly browse each of the three pages.

                <h5 class = "pb-3">Post-test Questionnaire</h5>
                <p>We provided questions for users to answer at the end of testing.
                    None of them answered these questions, but they did provide general feedback at
                    the end.</p>
                <ul class = "pb-5">
                    <li> What frustrated or confused you the most about this app?</li>
                    <li>If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this app?</li>
                    <li>What did you like about the app?</li>
                    <li>How likely are you to recommend this app to a friend or colleague
                        (0=Not at all likely, and 10=Very likely)?</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h5 class = "pb-3">Analysis</h5>
                <p class = "pb-4">The scenario we gave the users was to imagine they were using the app to
                    share photos of a trip with their friends. Overall, all three of the videos
                    were in line with our expectations. They completed the subtasks eventually with
                    few errors and were able to sign in to the app, take photos and share the photos
                    with the different groups. Below is a breakdown of user testing by subtask.
                </p>
    
                <h6 class = "pb-2">Task 1: Sign in & Explore!</h6>
                <p>Some users clicked the sign-up button first, but besides that, there was little
                    trouble signing in. Users had more challenge exploring the three tabs of
                    the app, specifically the home and the personal profile tabs.</p>
    
                <h6 class = "pt-3 pb-2">Task 2: React to an Image!</h6>
                <p>This task was completed very easily. All three of the users clicked on the image
                    and successfully reacted to an image. One user noted, however, that
                    they would have preferred for an indication that a user could react to an image. </p>
    
                <h6 class = "pt-3 pb-2">Task 3: Take & Send Pictures!</h6>
                <p class = "pb-1">For the last task, users all successfully completed the task of sending images to
                    the group chat. A small difficulty multiple users faced, however, was they tried
                    to click the images directly when prompted to select specific images to send,
                    before realizing that there was a select button later. </p>
    
                <h5 class = "pt-5 pb-3">Potential Interface Changes</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the functionality for users to select images without
                        clicking the select button when deciding which images to send to the group.</li>
                    <li>Add an indicator to each photo to remind users that they can react to the photo.</li>
                    <li>Change the personal profile page of the user to make it more clear what the
                        images found in the gallery actually are, by making the wording more specific.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center" id="conclusion">
                <h2 class = "pb-3">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Overall, we learned a lot about the importance of iterative design from this project. 
                    Our final prototype was very different from our initial sketches. 
                    It was a lot more fleshed out, due to all the feedback and corresponding changes 
                    we made from the group critiques and the ui/ux testing. After hearing from the startup,
                     we look forward to considering their feedback as well.
